"Level Difference Coloring":
  "Fields":
    "Positive or zero":
      "RGB": "0,255,0"
      "Description": "Adequacy is ranked at same level or higher as importance rank.
Current capability element is sufficiently adequate for the intended use, with no known deficiencies."
    "One level":
      "RGB": "255,255,0"
      "Description": "Adequacy is ranked one level below importance rank.
Current capability element is partially adequate for the intended use, with some known deficiencies."
    "Two or more levels":
      "RGB": "255,0,0"
      "Description": "Adequacy is ranked two levels below the importance rank.
Current capability element is insufficient and is not adequate for the intended use."
    "Not Addressed":
      "RGB": "198,89,17"
      "Description": "Adequacy is not \"addressed\""
    "N/A":
      "RGB": "217,217,217"

    "Importance": 
      "Description": "Guidelines for Importance Ranking "
      "Levels":
        "High": "Primary importance to quantity of interest in application scenario."
        "Medium": "Secondary importance to quantity of interest in application scenario."
        "Low": "Negligible importance to quantity of interest in application scenario."
        "Uncertain": "Unknown importance to quantity of interest in application scenario."
    "Math. Model Formulation": 
      "Description": "Guidelines for Assessing Mathematical Model Adequacy Ranking"
      "Levels":
        "High": "A mature physics-based model or correlation-based model is available that is established to adequately represent the phenomenon at the application conditions."
        "Medium": "Significant discovery activities have been completed. At least one candidate model form or correlation form has emerged that is believed to nominally capture the phenomenon over some portion of the application space."
        "Low": "No significant discovery activities have been completed and the model form is still unknown or speculative."
    "Code Implementation": 
      "Description": "Guidelines for Assessing Code Adequacy Ranking"
      "Levels":
        "High": "The math model is implemented in the code and enabling code features are fully operational. Verification problems have been run that test the correctness of the numerical implementation. There is a regression suite that is run routinely, and contains specific problems that test the implementation of the specified model. There are no outstanding (reported) bugs or issues that can undermine usage of the model."
        "Medium": "The math model is implemented in the code but certain enabling code features are not fully functional. The verification suite does not address the specific numerical implementation or the testing was qualitative. The regression suite is inadequate or does not specifically touch the phenomena of interest. There are no outstanding (reported) bugs or issues that can undermine credibility of the proposed calculations."
        "Low": "The math model is not implemented or not appropriately implemented in the code. Certain enabling code features are not functional preventing the calculation from being run. The verification suite or the regression suite is inadequate. There are outstanding code bugs or issues that must be resolved before model usage."
    "Validation": 
      "Description": "Guidelines for Assessing Validation Adequacy Ranking "
      "Levels":
        "High": "Significant validation evidence for quantifying the accuracy of the model use for the intended application. Numerical errors and predictive uncertainties of the model or correlation are quantified over the parameter space of the experimental database and the degree of extrapolation to the application is quantified and justifiable. The database is relevant to the application. "
        "Medium": "Partial validation evidence for quantifying the accuracy of the model use for the intended application. Some validation evidence exists, but there are known gaps. Numerical errors are unknown. Non-statistical comparisons of experiment data such as tabular comparisons or data trace overlays are employed. The degree of extrapolation to the application may not be quantified or is highly uncertain. The database may not be fully relevant to the application."
        "Low": "Insufficient validation evidence for model use. No significant comparisons with experiment data or ad hoc comparison of experiment images with prediction. The database is not relevant to the application."
    "Model Parameter": 
      "Description": "Guidelines for Assessing Model Parameter Adequacy Ranking"
      "Levels":
        "High": "Data-based (isotropic or orthotropic if needed) model parameters/functions are available, specific to the application material or model, with adequate state-variable dependency such as temperature dependence over the anticipated range of the application. This includes state or phase change behavior if expected such as, solid to liquid phase change."
        "Medium": "Application-specific model parameters/functions are available or can be estimated based on well-established 
theory or from calibration. Deficiencies in state-variable dependence, orthotropic behavior, or phase change behavior may exist relative to the application.
"
        "Low": "Not able to estimate some or all of the model parameters/functions because a relevant database is not available."
