	<h1>Credibility Framework</h1>
	<h2>General Description</h2>
	<p>This section defines Credibility Framework plugin context.</p>
	<h3>Product Scope</h3>
	<p>The Credibility Framework shall provide intuitive and coherent environment for ModSim teams to:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>define a Credibility Framework project to track evolution the credibility evidence associated with a particular ModSim task</li>
		<li>communicate credibility of computational simulation models</li>
		<li>provide and maintain links to configuration controlled artifacts constituting the evidence package</li>
		<li>tag the evidence package at significant stages of the ModSim program</li>
		<li>quantitatively assess the state of credibility if they choose</li>
		<li>support internal and external peer reviews</li>
		<li>conduct a historical review of credibility throughout the life of the ModSim project including understanding diverse input from different team and review panel members</li>
	</ul>
	<p>It is important that all behavior of the Credibility Framework are configurable by non-programmers without having to touch source code.</p>
	<h3>Product Perspective</h3>
	<p>Engineering credibility has been defined in many ways over the past two decades. Fundamentally credibility is a set of tools and processes for decision makers to understand why (or whether) they should trust the ModSim model to make decisions as
		well as develop a sense risk associated with making such decisions.</p>
	<p>The SAW Credibility Framework is an initial implementation of the credibility tools in SAW. It is largely a stand-alone Eclipse application intended to work seamlessly with the SAW analysis data management back-end to identify whether artifacts
		referenced by the credibility evidence package are under configuration control by the SAW Analysis Data Management layer.</p>
	<h3>Product Functions</h3>
	<p>On the high-level SAW Credibility framework implements a document management system and a guided information harvesting and ranking tool providing members of the ModSim team and reviewers to collect, disseminate and optionally rank groups of
		attributes of the ModSim activity.</p>
	<p>The Credibility Framework is not a physical experiment management of computational model execution platform, but it provides links to artifacts from those processes managed and executed by SAW.</p>
	<p>For example, definition, execution and post processing of a UQ study on a complex analysis workflow is managed by the SAW workflow engine, the Dakota wizard and results visualization tools.</p>
	<p>Consequently, the Credibility Framework under the Uncertainty Quantification sub element of PCMM maintains links to instances of the UQ studies and their documentation intended to provide evidence for making statements about margin
		uncertainties.</p>
	<h2>Configuration</h2>
	<p>Every credibility feature must be configurable by a non-programmer user. The choosen solution is to use Excel files to store credibility configuration.</p>
	<p>Excel files are not easily interpretables by Eclipse plugins. So the Excel file must contains a macro that convert it into interpretable file. The choosen configuration format is YAML (<code>*.yaml</code> or <code>*.yml</code>).</p>
	<p>See Generate Configuration for Credibility Project section for more implementation details.</p>
