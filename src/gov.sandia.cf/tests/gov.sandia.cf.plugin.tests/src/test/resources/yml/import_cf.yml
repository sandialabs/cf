                  incorrect material parameters. "Input deck" is also interpreted
                  in the large to include the geometric specifications (i.e. meshing
                  and geometries). The ultimate level of formality for this element
                  is a formal inspection of the input deck by a team including a scribe,
                  and one or more readers. If People do not know what this terminology
                  means they are not at level 3. This process is called a "formal
                  inspection" and derives exactly from formal software inspection
                  procedures well described in the software quality literature.

            "and computing their effect on the QOIs. This requires two or more simulations,
            where only one would be performed if the sensitivity was not studied.
            An obvious rational that could guide such a sensitivity study is to probe
            the selection of major features for meshing. It is also possible that
            "large" changes in represented geometry at this level and their computed
            effect on SRQs would be of interest and should be or could be presented.
            It is understood that the ability to conduct these studies becomes increasingly
            difficult as the level of geometric representation increases. "De-featuring"
            is broadly understood to mean variation in the geometric representation.
            Specifically this term implies coarsening the geometric representation
            (for example, reducing the number of major features that might be included
            at Level 1, or reducing the number of minor features included at level
            2.

            tests may be unit tests in the sense of SQE and have virtually nothing
            to do with the computational physics/engineering features of greatest
            interest. Regression also sometimes informally refers to "testing on a
            fixed schedule." In this sense, a defined VERTS can be part of a regression
            suite, or can be tested on its own schedule. Here we are emphasizing the
            intellectual difference between testing as a software engineering procedure
            and tests aimed at verifying the computational physics/engineering features.

            uncertainty; "characterized" = broader term than "quantified" but default
            to "quantified" if in doubt. See Sandia QMU documentation for presentation
            of aleatory and epistemic uncertainty logic. The key  implication is that
            characterization of aleatory uncertainty is technically different than
            that for epistemic uncertainty.

The most common EOS used together with programmed burn is the JWL EOS, which is an empirical EOS that is calibrated to cylinder test data. A complete JWL EOS requires specification of either the specific heat of the reacted explosive or the Chapman-Jouguet temperature, neither of which are available from cylinder test data. Reactive burn models ignore intermediate reaction steps and treat the explosive reaction as a single step from the condensed phase to gaseous reaction products. In contrast to programmed burn, which can only simulate steady detonation, reactive burn models can treat the growth of the explosive reaction within a shock wave and its transition into a detonation wave. All reactive burn models are composed of four main parts: (1) an EOS for the condensed phase, (2) an EOS for the gaseous reaction products, (3) a mixture rule for EOS of partially reacted material, and (4) a reaction rate model. &nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
