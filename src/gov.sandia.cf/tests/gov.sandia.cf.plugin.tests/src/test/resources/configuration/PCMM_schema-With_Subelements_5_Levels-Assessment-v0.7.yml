It is understood that the ability to conduct these studies becomes increasingly difficult as the level of geometric representation increases. \"De-featuring\" is broadly understood to mean variation in the geometric representation.

    PMMF:
      PMMF1:
        - "To what extent do the phenomena covered in the PIRT align with the major physics that are included in the application model, and are the same capabilities that were assessed in the PIRT applicableimulation been rigorously checked (by the analyst, by other analysts, by multiple other users, peer review panel (external or internal))?"
      PMMF2:
        - "Which individual phenomena have specific validation comparisons?"
